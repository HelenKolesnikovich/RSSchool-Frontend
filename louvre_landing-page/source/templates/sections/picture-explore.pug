        p.section-paragraph.picture-explore__text Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.
        p.section-paragraph.picture-explore__text It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a <a href="#" title="you can compare the picture" class="picture-explore__text--accent">"yellow veil"</a> of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century.
        p.section-paragraph.picture-explore__text The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different.
